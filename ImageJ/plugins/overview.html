Java/ImageJ implementation of the Viola/Jones face detection algorithm.
</p>

<p>
This library is a Java implementation of the Viola-Jones face detector 
[Paul Viola and Michael Jones, "Robust Real-time Face Detection", International Journal 
of Computer Vision 57.2 (2004), pp 137-154] to be used with ImageJ in conjunction with 
the 'imagingbook-common' library. It is adapted from the 'JViolaJones' implementation
(see <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/jviolajones/"> here</a>) by unknown authors.
Note that this software does not implement the learning part of the face detection 
algorithm but reads pre-learned decision trees (trained with OpenCV) and stored in XML 
format (in 'resources').
Also note that this code is experimental and not suitable for production use.
