# Java/ImageJ implementation of Viola-Jones face detection #

This Java library implements the face detection algorithm proposed by Viola and Jones. 
It does not include interest point detection and point correspondence calculations.
See this extensive [**report**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303233579_Zhang%27s_Camera_Calibration_Algorithm_In-Depth_Tutorial_and_Implementation) for details.

This implementation depends on 
[**ImageJ**](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/), 
the [**imagingbook-common**](https://bitbucket.org/imagingbook/imagingbook-public) library and 
[**Apache Commons Math**](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/).
